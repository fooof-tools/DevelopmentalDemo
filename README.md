# Spectral parameterization for studying neurodevelopment: How and why

Explicit parameterization of neural power spectra is an important step for understanding how dynamic neural communication contributes to normative and aberrant cognition across the lifespan. 

The goal of this tutorial is to provide helpful resources so that developmental cognitive neuroscientists may seamlessly integrate the spectral parameterization ("specparam") toolbox into their processing pipeline for pediatric EEG data. Specifically, we provide code to parameterize individual and group power spectral data, via specparam, in R Studio and Jupiter Notebook. 

Please see the accompanying manuscript for a detailed description of the processing steps using each program, as well as a theoretical explanation of the importance of spectral parameterization for developmental cognitive neuroscientists (see also [Donoghue et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-020-00744-x)).

Please feel free to contact Brendan Ostlund (bdo12@psu.edu) and/or Thomas Donoghue (tdonoghu@ad.ucsd.edu) with questions, comments, or concerns related to the code.
