# Python / Jupyter Notebook Examples

These notebooks introduce using spectral parameterization to developmental EEG data, using Python, in Jupyter notebooks.

### 01-IndividualPSD

This notebook introduces spectral parameterization and applies it to a single power spectrum.

### 02-GroupPSDs

This notebook applies spectral parameterization to a group of power spectra.


# Setting up Juypter Notebook
For novice users, we recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a widely-used Python distribution platform that comes equipped with Python, Jupyter, and a myriad of essential Python libraries. Included in the Anaconda installation is [Anaconda Navigator](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/anaconda-navigator), a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) that allows a user to launch Jupyter Notebook and manage conda packages without the use of the Terminal. 

Launching Jupyter via the Anaconda Navigator GUI will open the Notebook Dashboard in a new tab in the user’s web browser. In this case, Jupyter initiates a local Python server, which hosts and runs on the user’s computer. At the Notebook Dashboard, navigate to the folder where the “01-IndividualPSD.ipynb” file is located and open the script.
